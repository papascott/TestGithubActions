# Setting up PagePark on DigitalOcean from scratch

This is a line of random text

1. And the first entry of a numbered list item

1. Tip: add an SSH key to your <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/security">DigitalOcean Security settings</a> to make logging in easier

1. Spin up an Ubuntu droplet (choose the SSH key you uploaded earlier)

Does this help?
