# Building Mac electron apps (like Electric Drummer) for Linux and Windows

These are my instructions for building electron apps for Mac (like those developed by <a href="https://github.com/scripting">Dave Winer</a>) for Linux and Windows. As with most things, there is "more than one way to do it", but this worked for me.

I've tested this with the Electric Drummer and the Public Folder apps. I work on a Mac with MacOS 12.3 (Monterey) and Node.js 16 (v16.14.0).
