# Building Mac electron apps (like Electric Drummer) for Linux and Windows

These are my instructions for building electron apps for Mac (like those developed by <a href="https://github.com/scripting">Dave Winer</a>) for Linux and Windows. As with most things, there is "more than one way to do it", but this worked for me.

For now I am only building zip files of the app, not packages that can be properly installed  in Linux and Windows.

I've tested this with the <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/electricDrummer.opml">Electric Drummer</a> and <a href="http://this.how/publicFolder/">Public Folde</a>r apps. I work on a Mac with MacOS 12.3 (Monterey) and Node.js 16 (v16.14.0).  

### electron-builder

There are several alternative tools for building electron apps (including <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron-packager">electron-packager</a>, <a href="https://www.electronforge.io/">electron-forge</a>, <a href="https://www.electron.build/">electron-builder</a>). I found electron-builder to be the easiest and have the most options for building multi-platform apps.


Install the latest electron-builder globally with `npm install -g electron-builder`


### Configuration

electron-builder can be <a href="https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration">configured</a> within package.json (in a 'build' key) or a separate file. I chose to use an electron-builder.json file.

The existing Public Folder app was built with `sudo electron-packager . "Public Folder" --platform=darwin --arch=all --overwrite --icon=bowlingBall.icns --electron-version=7.1.10`, so I incorporated these settings into my  electron-builder.json

My minimal electron-builder.json (for Public Folder)

```

{

"electronVersion": "7.1.10",

"directories": {

"buildResources": "."

},

"mac": {

"target": "zip",

"identity": null,

"icon": "bowlingBall.icns"

},

"win": {

"target": "zip",

"icon": "bowlingBall.png"

},

"linux": {

"target": "zip"

}

}

```

### Comments on the configuration

- `directories`: where electron-buiders expects to find the icons. They are in the root directory, so we specify '.' .

- `identity: null`: prevents the app from being signed with an existing Apple Developer ID, you may not need this. I did. 

- If you only have an icon in .icns format, Windows will need an icon as .png or .ico.

- electron-packager requires 'name', 'version', 'author' and 'description' keys to be present in package.json.

### Build command

`electron-builder -mwl ` (short for `electron-builder --mac --windows --linux`). The zip files are saved in a 'dist' directory. For Public Folder I got `electronPublicFolder-0.4.6-mac.zip`, `electronPublicFolder-0.4.6-win.zip` and `electronPublicFolder-0.4.6.zip` (for Linux).
